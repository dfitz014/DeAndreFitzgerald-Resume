        <div class="subheading mb-5">Economics/Adminstrative StudiesðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I was born December 15, 2002 in Sacramento, CA into a middle-class family.. I attended West Campus High School in Sacramento and graduated with a respectable 3.3 GPA. I was not able to partake in many after school clubs, however I participated in my school's acting club my Freshman, Sophomore, and Junior year. While attending, I had roles in two plays and helped direct a third. These experiences helped me learn how to work in group settings as well as how to properly lead and direct a group of people in a way that is both respectful and effective. It was here I also learned how to work with people whom I may not like as not everyone in the group was friendly towards me.<br><br>

        In my freetime, I enjoy consuming foreign media in order to expand my knowledge and keep myself open to new experiences. This also helps challenge some of my past beliefs in ways I would be unable to if I were to ignore the foureign input. I also enjoy car racing, a sport in which I also actively participate in. This sport allows me to distract myself from the hustle and bustle of normal life, as well as giving me an outlet to relieve any stress that I may feel. I began racing cars at a young age with my father, and have dealt with many instances of frustrations including my car breaking during competitions or me making a mistake which lead to my defeat. Since I have faced many of these challenges, I have learned how to problem solve quickly and without the best tools in order to proceed forward. Racing has also introduced me to a number of people from socio-economic backgrounds incredibly different then my own. This can be seen as an advantage if hired to your company as it shows that I will be able to take charge in times of stress and help where needed.<br><br>

        I currently go to school at the University of California: Riverside and plan on double-majoring in Economics/Administrative Studies and Business with a focus on accounting. Although I am only in my second quarter here, I currently have a 3.2 GPA and have taken a heavy load of 18 credits both quarters. Despite this, I have been able to maintain a healthy social life as well and have made a number of good friends both inside my dorm hall and on campus. Due to not having my car, I have not been able to explore the Southern California area much yet but plan on making a trip to San Diego in the near future. I also have begun the process of studying abroad as I believe the experience will help me expand my horizons and challenge any stereotypes I may unconsciously be holding onto. This will also allow me to experience other cultures and is an example of how I am able to work with anyone, no matter their country of origin or background.
